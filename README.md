## DAO for your NFT holders

To be able to purchase NFTs automatically when a proposal is passed, you need an on-chain NFT marketplace that you can call a purchase() function on. 

There exist a lot of NFT marketplaces out there, but to avoid overcomplicating things, we will create a simplified fake NFT marketplace for this project as the focus is on the DAO.

We will also make the actual DAO smart contract using Hardhat.

We will make the website using Next.js to allow users to create and vote on proposals


## Requirements

Anyone with a CryptoDevs NFT can create a proposal to purchase a different NFT from an NFT marketplace.

Everyone with a CryptoDevs NFT can vote for or against the active proposals.

Each NFT counts as one vote for each proposal.

Voter cannot vote multiple times on the same proposal with the same NFT

If majority of the voters vote for the proposal by the deadline, the NFT purchase is automatically executed.
